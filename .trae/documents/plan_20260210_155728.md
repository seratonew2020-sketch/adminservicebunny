Based on the analysis of the logs and the current state of the backend:

**1. Analysis of the Error (วิเคราะห์ปัญหา)**
*   **Current Error:** The logs show **404 Not Found** for `/api/employees/user/...` and `/api/holidays`. This means the server is running, but these specific "routes" (paths) are not recognized.
*   **Root Cause:** The `server.ts` file (used for local development) has the code to register these routes, but for some reason, they are not being loaded active. This is likely due to how `tsx` (the tool running the server) handles the import of `.js` files from `.ts` files, or the server process didn't restart properly to pick up the changes.

**2. Files Checked (ไฟล์ที่ตรวจสอบ)**
*   `backend/src/server.ts`: Confirmed it contains `fastify.register(employeeRoutes, ...)` and `fastify.register(holidayRoutes, ...)`.
*   `backend/src/routes/employees.js`: Confirmed it exports the function correctly as `export default`.
*   `vite.config.js`: Confirmed Proxy settings are correct (`127.0.0.1:5000`).

**3. Root Cause Summary (สรุปสาเหตุ)**
*   **Route Registration Ineffective:** The code to register routes exists but isn't taking effect in the running process.
*   **Process State:** The backend server might need a hard restart or debug logging to confirm it is actually loading the route files.

**4. Step-by-Step Plan (แผนการแก้ไข)**
1.  **Add Debug Logging:** Modify `backend/src/server.ts` to print all registered routes on startup (`fastify.printRoutes()`). This will confirm immediately if the routes are loaded or ignored.
2.  **Hard Restart Backend:** Stop the current backend process completely and start it fresh to ensure no cached files or old states are persisting.
3.  **Verify Endpoints:** Test the API again with `curl`. If routes appear, the frontend will work.

**5. Request for Permission (ขออนุญาต)**
I am ready to modify `backend/src/server.ts` to add debug logs and restart the server. May I proceed?
