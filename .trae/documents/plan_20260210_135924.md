I will fix the 500 Internal Server Error by investigating the backend code and data state, then verify the fix.

1. **Inspect Code**: Check `backend/src/routes/employees.js` and `backend/src/server.js` to ensure there are no syntax errors or logic that could cause a crash on Vercel (like `require` usage).
2. **Verify Data**: Run a script to confirm that the employee profile for user `f38727de-5557-4c94-8382-5200c032d45a` exists and is valid in the database.
3. **Implement Fixes**: Apply any necessary code corrections to prevent crashes.
4. **Explain in Thai**: Summarize the problem and solution step-by-step in Thai as requested.
